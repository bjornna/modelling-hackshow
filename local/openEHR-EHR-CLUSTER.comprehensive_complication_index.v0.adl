			purpose = <"The Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI®) calculator is a tool to support the assessment of patients’ overall morbidity after an intervention. The CCI® is based on the complication grading by the Clavien-Dindo Classification and captures every complication that occurred after an intervention. The overall morbidity is reflected on a scale from 0 (no complication) to 100 (death) and reflects the gravity of this overall complication burden on the patient. The CCI® was developed together with patients to ensure the patients’ perspective is represented in the scale. The CCI® formula adjusts for the number and severity of the complications and is not a simple summation of all complication grades. This index allows the observation of morbidity over the course of time as it can be recalculated every time the patient is followed-up or at predefined time points (e.g., at discharge, 30 days postoperatively etc.).

The CCI® has been validated in several independent patient cohorts, underlining its reproducibility, and the CCI® is a sensitive endpoint when assessing outcome. The CCI® is especially useful for randomized trials, as smaller sample sizes suffice to detect significant difference in outcome (as every patient has a CCI®, even if it is zero) compared to using binary outcomes (e.g., yes/no complication or complication ≤3a vs. >3a). It was shown that overall morbidity measured by CCI® correlates strongly with treatment cost, and more strongly that using only the highest complication according to the Clavien-Dindo classification.">
